# Summary

This is a motorized door lock inspired by The Amazing Spider Man. It makes use of a rack and pinion which converts the rotary movement of a servo motor to linear movement. Once the rack is extended, it fits into the "rack holder" which is screwed into your door frame. This model requires the use of a standard sized 180 degree servo motor (40.8 × 20.1 × 38 mm). If anyone needs the model to be updated to fit a smaller or larger motor, please leave a comment and I will upload the new models. 

UPDATE: The motor holder has been updated and redesigned to increase the strength and fix some modelling issues.

UPDATE 2: The chamfer on the Gear model has been removed. The object will now print without the use of supports or slight drooping.

# Instructions

Firstly print out all parts in the orientation that it was imported:
The "Gear" can be at a low infill (~20-30%). (No Support)  
The "Motor_Holder" needs to be printed at a high resolution and high infill (~70-100%).(Support)  
The "Rack" should be printed at about 50% infill and lastly,  (No Support)  
The "Rack_Holder" should be printed at 100%  (No Support)  

The rack holder needs to be screwed into your door frame. Make sure it is well aligned so the rack fits nicely when it is extended.

The rack will slot into the Motor_Holder but you may be required to add a plate on the top of the rack to prevent it from falling out when mounted on a door. If youre using it on a table or desk, you will not need to add the plate.

Mount the motor into the large area on the Motor_Holder. The screws should line up nicely however you may need to tap or drill out the holes because of printer inaccuracies. M3 screws need to be used. Use M3 screws or bolts to mount the entire holder onto your door or on whatever you choose to use the mechanism on. 

The gear can then be screwed onto the servo motor using the screws which were provided when you bought the motor.
